Random seed: ${randomSeed}
Time: ${timeOfDay}
Mood: ${emotion}

STUDY THESE ACTUAL #1 COUNTRY HITS:
- "Cruise" - simple action, feelgood
- "Body Like a Back Road" - catchy comparison
- "Dirt Road Anthem" - place + attitude
- "Chicken Fried" - food = comfort
- "Red Solo Cup" - specific object for partying
- "She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy" - funny, memorable
- "Wagon Wheel" - place name that's singable
- "Achy Breaky Heart" - simple feeling
- "Friends in Low Places" - relatable situation

WHAT WORKS:
- SHORT (3-5 words max)
- CONCRETE objects/actions (not abstract concepts)
- SINGABLE and REPEATABLE
- Makes you FEEL GOOD or RELATE instantly
- Often about: trucks, beer, love, heartbreak, small towns, Friday nights

DO NOT CREATE:
- Abstract metaphors like "Coffee Cup Cathedral"
- Wordy concepts like "Sunday School Parking Brake"
- Philosophy like "Muddy Water Optimist"
- Anything that needs explanation

CREATE A HOOK LIKE:
- "Backroad Baptism" - getting wild on dirt roads
- "Truck Bed Sunrise" - romantic moment
- "Whiskey Weather" - drinking mood
- "Barefoot Blue Jean Night" - summer fun
- "Pontoon" - one word, instant image
- "Dirt on My Boots" - simple, visual
- "Beer Never Broke My Heart" - funny truth

Your hook should be:
- ${emotion} mood
- Set in/around: ${setting}
- Something you'd hear on the radio
- Instantly memorable
- Makes people want to turn it up

Give me ONLY the hook (3-5 words). Make it a potential #1 hit, not poetry.`;

Random seed: ${randomSeed}
Time: ${timeOfDay}
Mood: ${emotion}
Setting: ${setting}

BALANCED HITS TO STUDY:
- "Amarillo By Morning" - place with emotion
- "Friends in Low Places" - relatable story, great hook
- "The Dance" - metaphor that's accessible
- "Strawberry Wine" - nostalgic storytelling
- "Something to Be Proud Of" - meaningful but singable
- "Live Like You Were Dying" - deep message, catchy

CREATE A HOOK THAT:
- Has commercial appeal AND meaning
- 3-6 words (can be slightly longer than pure radio)
- Tells a story people connect with
- Still singable and memorable
- Can work on radio but has depth

AVOID:
- Overly complex metaphors
- Pure clichÃ©s without twist
- Anything too abstract

Your hook should capture the ${emotion} mood at ${timeOfDay} near the ${setting}.

Give me ONLY the hook.`;

Random seed: ${randomSeed}

ARTISTIC COUNTRY MASTERPIECES:
- "He Stopped Loving Her Today" - story-driven classic
- "The Grand Tour" - extended metaphor
- "Coat of Many Colors" - personal narrative
- "Sunday Morning Coming Down" - atmospheric poetry
- "Pancho and Lefty" - character-driven
- "Coffee Cup Cathedral" - unexpected metaphor
- "Digital Bonfire" - modern meets traditional

CREATE A HOOK THAT:
- Prioritizes artistic expression
- Can be longer (4-8 words)
- Uses unexpected metaphors or imagery
- Tells a deeper story
- May challenge listeners but rewards them
- Has layers of meaning

EMBRACE:
- Complex emotions
- Unusual word combinations
- Poetic language
- Character-driven narratives
- Social commentary

Your hook should evoke ${emotion} at ${timeOfDay} near the ${setting}, but with artistic depth.

Give me ONLY the hook. Make it thought-provoking and memorable.`;
