# Alex Wilson Country Song Generator - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This app generates country songs in the authentic style of Alex Wilson, a fictional country singer-songwriter from Pike County, Kentucky. The implementation is grounded in two comprehensive songwriting guides that define both general country music best practices and Alex Wilson's specific style.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Artist Attribution
- All generated songs include `"artist": "Alex Wilson"` in JSON exports
- Markdown and PDF exports display "by Alex Wilson"
- The UI prominently features Alex Wilson branding

### 2. Character Background (Integrated into Prompts)
- **Born**: July 12, 2005 in Pikeville, Kentucky

- **Ethos**: "Work hard, tell the truth, never become my father"
- **Instruments**: Acoustic guitar (primary), fiddle, piano, banjo, mandolin

### 3. Songwriting Style (Core to Generation)

#### Storytelling First
- Authentic, honest narratives rooted in real experiences
- Concrete imagery: rust on fenders, dime-store rings, creaky porches
- Appalachian settings: mountains, hollers, creeks, small towns
- Sensory details that make stories feel lived-in

#### Hook-Driven Approach
- Central memorable phrase that becomes the title
- Must have clever twist, double meaning, or payoff
- Examples from Alex's catalog:
  - "Tin Band Dreams" - ring made of tin celebrates love over wealth
  - "Biscuits & Regret" - hangover comfort food
  - "Digital Bonfire" - online warmth vs real connection

#### Language & Tone
- Plain, conversational English reflecting rural Kentucky
- Natural rhymes (AABB or ABAB)
- Colloquialisms ("ain't," "holler," "gonna") without caricature
- Vulnerability and raw emotion

### 4. Musical Elements by Sub-Genre

The generator adapts instrumentation based on selected sub-genre:
- **Bluegrass**: Acoustic guitar, banjo, fiddle, upright bass
- **Honky-Tonk**: Piano, pedal steel, twangy electric guitar
- **Outlaw/Americana**: Raw acoustic guitar, harmonica, minimal production
- **Country Pop**: Acoustic/electric guitars, banjo fills, polished drums
- **Modern/Crossover**: Can include drum machines, synth pads, 808 bass

### 5. Thematic Range

- Love & relationships (devoted, uncertain, rebellious)
- Heartbreak & regret (hangovers, lost love)
- Rural life (working land, fixing trucks)
- Bar culture (dive bars, honky-tonks)
